\begin{abstract}
Ecological, behavioral, and biomechanical studies often need to quantify movement and behavior in three dimensions.  In laboratory studies, a major tool to accomplish these is the use of multiple, calibrated high-speed cameras.  Until very recently, complexity, weight and cost of such cameras has made their deployment in field situations risky; furthermore such cameras are often not affordable for early career researchers, teaching use by undergraduates, or for those not in biomechanics who don't have an overriding primary need for such toys.  Here we describe a solution and tool set using multiple inexpensive cameras to bridge such needs.  The availability of lower cost, portable and rugged solutions (and the likely future ubiquity of inexpensive cameras of reasonable performance) has promise to open up new areas of biological study by providing precise, 3D tracking and quantification of movement to more researchers.
